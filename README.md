# React/TypeScript Weather app

## Overview

This was my first attempt at building an App with Typescript, and also first time using Tailwind for styling.

## Core Requirements

- The app should be in TypeScript
- The user should be able to input the name of a city and have weather information about that city added to the page.
- The app should have at least one other function/feature in addition to being able to check weather information about a city.
- Style your components with Tailwind.
- Animate at least one element on your app using a React animation library (in this case, Framer).
