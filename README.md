# React/TypeScript Hackathon

## Challenge

Build a weather checker app using TypeScript and React that satisfies all of the requirements below.

## Core Requirements

### Planning and documentation

- Before coding your app, you should use the draw.io VS code extension to create a component tree diagram within this repository.
- Each component in the diagram should have its states and behaviors noted.
- Your app should have a readme that describes its functionality and how it should be used. You can use a tool like [Readme.so](https://readme.so/editor) to help do this.

### Code and functionality

- Your app should be in TypeScript! Remember to reference the [React/TypeScript cheat sheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#reacttypescript-cheatsheets) and other resources (and Google) to help.
- The user should be able to input the name of a city and have weather information about that city added to the page. Use the following API to get your weather information: https://openweathermap.org/api. You'll need to sign up for the free tier to get an API key.
- Your app should have at least one other function/feature in addition to being able to check weather information about a city. Be creative!

### Styling and UI

- Style at least one of your components with Tailwind.
- For any styling not done via Tailwind, write your CSS in a CSS module.
- Animate at least one element on your app using a React animation library (Framer or Spring).
